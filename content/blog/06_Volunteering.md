## Past Volunteer Work

While a lot of this work is somewhat outdated, both of these projects feel very important to me. I think volunteering to help out a community you are a part of helps everyone involved grow as people and will ideally help the world to be a place more suited to all.

### Intubation Boxes

This is the volunteer project I feel most passionately about- my grandparents were some of the first victims of COVID in Texas and the US as a whole. They both needed to be intubated, and they were in very real danger that required lots of prayer and many sleepless nights worrying and hoping that they would come home.

This project to create cheap, easily distributable intubation boxes for the underfunded hospitals that were in dire need of more sparked a passion in me. If these boxes could help prevent other families, including those of the healthcare workers, from the worry that ours had to go through, I was more than glad to help.

### Pangea Network

This is a project I worked on with a small group of other high school students to help support the operation of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit called The Pangea Network. The aim of The Pangea Network was to support the education of women and youth in Kenya and the United States. The project helps to alleviate the systemic challenges that face many groups, especially those that face poverty or oppression on the boundary of gender, and supports them to pursue higher education and to give back to their communities.

Our task was to help raise awareness for The Pangea Network through various means, such as community outreach events and raising awareness of all the work The Pangea Network has done to help many people pursue education and grow beyond what the limits that their environment would have otherwise placed on them.

### Debate

After learning and competing in debate at the junior high level for both years, I returned the year after when I graduated to high school in order to assist and teach students struggling in the art of debate and oration. I primarily helped with PF debate, working with the student teams to help them create a more cohesive brief with more robust and powerful attacks and defenses as well as guiding them on how to convey their points and convince the audience that their position was the correct one.

### Ironman

I also volunteered at the local Ironman triathlon in The Woodlands by acting as a volunteer for the transitionary stage between the biking and running portions. Since I was, and still am to a lesser degree, a runner, I felt both awestruck and the urge to help each person who came through to have as few worries outside the race as possible. I will admit, I don't like germs all that much, so helping move and secure the bikes was unnerving since many bikes are soiled or otherwise dirty after this segment, but I was still glad to help each athlete to have the easiest time possible moving from one portion of their monumental race to another. I personally hope to do an Ironman in the future as well, but since I'm not great at swimming, I need to have a great deal of time to train for it.

## Future Goals

While I want to volunteer more, it is difficult to think of how I can help with something that I feel passionately about. While I'm sure I could find a place to volunteer and be useful, it feels hard to justify if I'm not terribly passionate about the project, especially since I have many other personal and professional projects I DO feel passionately about. Keep an eye on this page, though, because I may have projects in this area coming soon.
