# Thanks for dropping in!

## Why did I create this project?

This is a simple project I created over this winter break. Doing this helped me learn how to use GitHub and VSCode more efficiently, which will be helpful as I previously was using them much more inefficiently and did not understand their capabilities.

## What have I learned?

It also helped me understand aspects of the internet I hadn't explored deeply before. In my cybersecurity class, I learned about the internet and important aspects of websites, such as certificates, but putting mine together from scratch has helped me understand the process a lot better now!

# Updates

## Update: 2025-01-11

I have uploaded a new page about my experience running a multiphysics MOOSE simulation. On the page, I have tried to upload a video to the website! It has been a challenge, and I haven't gotten it to work quite yet, but I am proud of learning more about HTML from this effort.

## Update: 2025-02-16

I have uploaded two new pages detailing work performed in my deep learning class. In both posts, I successfully embedded images. I attempted to remedy the MOOSE post by similarly embedding the videos but ended up not functioning as expected. Further attempts will be made as I learn more.

I also updated the categories into two main post types, 'Work' and 'Get to know me'. Both are arbitrarily assigned, and the overlap, especially in categories such as cybersecurity, is small. This is relevant because I have created several draft posts that I will publish as time goes on.
