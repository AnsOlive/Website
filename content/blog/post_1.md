# Thanks for dropping in!

## Why did I create this project?

This is a simple project I created over this winter break. Doing this helped me learn how to use Github and VScode more efficently, which will be helpful as I previously was using them much more inefficently and did not understand their capabilities.

## What have I learned?

It also helped me understand aspects of the internet I hadn't explored deeply before. In my cybersecurity class I learned about the internet and important aspects of websites such as certificates, but putting mine together from scratch has helped me understand the process a lot better now!
