# Thanks for dropping in!

## What have I learned?

Learning SolidWorks has been useful in many different ways- I learned it for robotics, then applied it to 3D printing for prototyping, and finally understood how these models can be meshed for simulation.

### FRC Robotics

I utilized SolidWorks on my high school robotics team, FRC 1477 Texas Torque. While that was not my usual or main task, I helped with updating outdated CAD files and the initial drafting of CAD models at the start of the season, among other minor tasks. I also often used these models to fabricate and process the needed parts using tools like a CNC milling machine.

### Robotics Class

In high school I also utilized SolidWorks in a robotics class and created a gearbox assembly that I manufactured using the tools in the lab afterwards. I have since lost the files for it since I was not as meticulous as I am now on recordkeeping, but I still have the physical gearbox as a reminder of my work during that period of time.

### TURTLE Robotics

I was in a robotics club at A&M called TURTLE Robotics that worked on various projects- while I was there, I worked on two. One was an introduction project to create a miniature RC car to play soccer; after that, I moved to a project to create an automatic system to care for plants. Our test crop was radishes, and I helped with the design of the body and frame before I left the club to have more time to work on research and work at the NESC (Nuclear Engineering and Science Center).

### Microdosimetry

For this project, I took initial known designs for a microdosimeter and modified them to become a couple of different designs to fit the specifications needed for our test microdosimeter. Since the initial test product was meant to be 3D printable, I also needed to consider the printability and tolerances of the product after printing. This took a couple of attempts due to needing to understand how the thermal expansion of the microdosimeter affected how the parts would fit together after cooling.

## Goals

I want to get a CSWA certificate. A&M helps support this aim through the [FEDC (Fisher Engineering and Design Center)](https://fedc.engr.tamu.edu/pop-up-classes/cad-cam-design/solidworks-exam-request/). The only obstacle at this stage is my lack of practice lately and a computer capable of running it. My current computer is incompatible with SolidWorks, and running it with a VM is resource-intensive, making it difficult to run smoothly. I plan on practicing more soon and obtaining a certificate.
