      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;thanks-for-dropping-in&#34;&gt;Thanks for dropping in!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-did-i-learn-from-this-project&#34;&gt;What did I learn from this project?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a slightly older project that I collaborated on using MOOSE in sophomore year. It was my first introduction to multiphysics modeling and simulation, which is now one of my key interests. It also showed me the importance of understanding software from a (slightly) lower level of code, a lesson I have used a lot recently to help with my current research project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;thanks-for-dropping-in&#34;&gt;Thanks for dropping in!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-i-create-this-project&#34;&gt;Why did I create this project?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a simple project I created over this winter break. Doing this helped me learn how to use Github and VScode more efficently, which will be helpful as I previously was using them much more inefficently and did not understand their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-have-i-learned&#34;&gt;What have I learned?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also helped me understand aspects of the internet I hadn&amp;rsquo;t explored deeply before. In my cybersecurity class I learned about the internet and important aspects of websites such as certificates, but putting mine together from scratch has helped me understand the process a lot better now!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
