      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;thanks-for-dropping-in&#34;&gt;Thanks for dropping in!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-i-create-this-project&#34;&gt;Why did I create this project?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a simple project I created over this winter break. Doing this helped me learn how to use Github and VScode more efficently, which will be helpful as I previously was using them much more inefficently and did not understand their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-have-i-learned&#34;&gt;What have I learned?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also helped me understand aspects of the internet I hadn&amp;rsquo;t explored deeply before. In my cybersecurity class I learned about the internet and important aspects of websites such as certificates, but putting mine together from scratch has helped me understand the process a lot better now!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
